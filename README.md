## Naive Bayes’ Classifier 

A Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple data classifier used in machine learning and data mining. It relies on Bayes’ Theorem, and is based on certain probabilistic assumptions about independence that may not hold in practice. 

The program has two parts.

###  Training
In this part, we give computer a set of data and let it learn and store them

### Classify 
In this part, we give computer a set of descriptions and let it decide which object fit most based on the information it has learnt during training.  The classifying process utilizes Bayes' Theorem and Laplacian Smoothing.
